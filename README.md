# Bio-reactor Engineering Challenege 2 UCL
## Project Brief 
The files contain the project of building a Bio-reactor prototype for the vaccination production factory in Uganda. Students from EEE Dept. collaborate with students from CS Dept. to build the bio-reactor which controls the stirring speed of the motor, the pH value of the environment, and the temperature inside the container from Arduino UNO. 

The control parameters are determined by the user remotely by using WiFi and Thingsboard, which is used for user interface. Thus, an ESP32 board was used for WiFi connection and a logical shifter was imiplemented to create the communication between Arduino and ESP32.
